## Strategic Partner Criteria

### Who We WANT
| Attribute | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| PPRA-registered with valid FFC | Non-negotiable — cannot operate without |
| Trust account in place (auditors listed) | Required for rent/deposit handling |
| 5-15 years experience | Knows the business, has credibility |
| 50-500 properties under management | Big enough to be credible, small enough to need help |
| Weak on technology | NEEDS Ampersand — won't try to build it themselves |
| Weak on marketing/investor acquisition | NEEDS Ampersand — doesn't have pipeline |
| Ambitious but stuck | Has growth aspiration but lacks the tools |
| Owner-operated or small principal team | Can make partnership decisions quickly |
| Financial reports current (2024/2025) | Compliance indicator |

### Who We DON'T Want
| Attribute | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Tech-savvy founders | Will take the idea and build it themselves |
| Already vertically integrated | Don't need us (e.g., IGrow) |
| Very large corporates (10,000+ units) | Too slow, politics, won't prioritise a JV |
| Pure sales agents (no management) | Don't have operational capability |
| Bad reputation / compliance issues | Liability, won't pass due diligence |
| No auditors or outdated financial reports | Compliance risk |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | 10 Equity Drive, Randburg, 2194 |
| **Tel** | 072 322 9774 |
| **Principal** | Rotondwa Sadiki |

---

### 8. Mafadi Property Management ⚠️ REPUTATION RISK

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Location** | JHB CBD, Midrand, Centurion, Pretoria, KZN |
| **Scale** | 28,000 properties |
| **Reviews** | Poor (Trustpilot, HelloPeter) |

**Review Summary:**
- "Spaza shop operations"
- Communication failures
- Maintenance not done

**Consideration:** Scale is impressive, but brand reputation would taint Keystay. Could consider portfolio acquisition later rather than partnership.

---

## DO NOT APPROACH

| Company | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Trafalgar** | Too big (85,000 units, 550 staff). Won't prioritise a JV. |
| **Broll Property Group** | Too big (USD812m assets). Global partnerships in place. |
| **IGrow** | Direct competitor. Already vertically integrated. |
| **Propr Luxury Homes** | Tech-savvy founders. Will steal the idea. |
| **Houst** | Global company, tech-enabled. Don't need us. |
| **Any "proptech" founders** | Will take the idea and build it themselves. |

---

## Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Priority Outreach (This Week)

**Target:** Fitzanne Estates
- Research Pieter Fitzgerald and Pearl on LinkedIn
- Prepare personalised email referencing their NAMA membership and 43-year track record
- Emphasise investor acquisition as new revenue stream

**Target:** Pro Admin
- Research Charles Higgins on LinkedIn
- Assess their appetite for investor-facing business
- Position as platform partnership, not competition

### Phase 2: Secondary Outreach

- Pretor Property Management (after verifying current FFC)
- Gauteng Management Agents (after PPRA verification)

### Message Framework

```
Hi [Name],

I've been researching property management companies in Gauteng for a
venture I'm developing, and [Company Name] stood out — [specific
observation: compliance track record / years in business / scale].

I'm building Keystay — a platform that connects investors with
investment properties and provides end-to-end management (sourcing,
tenant placement, property management, reporting). Think of it as
the full service that IGrow promises but fails to deliver.

What I bring: Technology platform, systems, investor acquisition.
What I need: A partner with PPRA registration, operational
experience, and the ambition to build something at scale.

Your [specific strength] combined with our technology could create
something neither could build alone. Would you be open to a
20-minute call to explore?

[Signature]
```
