# Keystay: Regulatory & Compliance Framework

**Date:** 20 January 2026
**Status:** Research Complete — Requires Legal Review
**Jurisdiction:** South Africa

---

## Executive Summary

Operating Keystay in South Africa requires navigating multiple regulatory frameworks depending on which services are offered. This document maps every regulatory requirement, required license, and partner type needed to operate legally.

**Critical finding:** Keystay cannot operate without a PPRA-registered property practitioner as the operating partner. This is non-negotiable for any fee-earning property transaction activity.

---

## Part 1: Regulatory Landscape Overview

### Key Regulatory Bodies

| **FIC** (Financial Intelligence Centre) | Anti-money laundering | FICA compliance required for all property transactions |
| **SARS** | Tax | VAT, income tax, transfer duty |
| **Legal Practice Council** | Attorneys | Conveyancing, trust accounts |

---

## Part 2: Service-by-Service Requirements

### 2.1 Property Sourcing & Sales

**What we do:** Find investment properties, facilitate sales to buyers (full or fractional ownership)

#### Required Registrations

| Requirement | Who Holds It | Cost | Timeline |
|-------------|--------------|------|----------|
| PPRA Registration (Firm) | Operating Partner | R2,340/3 years | Prerequisite |
| Fidelity Fund Certificate | Operating Partner | Included above | Annual renewal |
| FIC Registration | Operating Partner | Free | Before operations |
| Trust Account | Operating Partner | Bank fees | Month 1 |
| IRBA Auditor | JV contracts | R15-30k/year | Annual |

#### FICA Compliance Requirements

As an "Accountable Institution," Keystay must:

1. **Client verification before any transaction:**
   - Certified ID/passport (not older than 3 months)
   - Proof of residential address
   - Source of funds documentation
   - For companies: CIPC documents (CK1, CK2)

2. **Risk-Based Approach:**
   - Standard due diligence for normal transactions
   - Enhanced due diligence for:
     - Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)
     - Unusually large cash transactions
     - Offshore clients

3. **Record keeping:** 5 years minimum after transaction completion

4. **Suspicious transaction reporting** to FIC

**Context:** South Africa was grey-listed by FATF in 2023. Strict FICA compliance is essential.

#### Consumer Protection Act Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Property Disclosure Form | Must be completed BEFORE accepting mandate |
| Material fact disclosure | All known defects, zoning issues, environmental concerns |
| No misleading representations | Cannot use exaggeration or ambiguity |
| Attached to sale agreement | Disclosure document must precede and be annexed to sale |

**Penalty for non-compliance:** Up to R1 million or 10% of turnover

#### Transfer Duty (Buyer Pays)

| Property Value | Transfer Duty |
|----------------|---------------|
| R0 – R1,210,000 | Exempt |
| R1,210,001 – R1,663,800 | 3% of value above R1,210,000 |
| R1,663,801 – R2,330,000 | R13,614 + 6% of value above R1,663,800 |
| R2,330,001 – R2,996,400 | R53,586 + 8% of value above R2,330,000 |
| R2,996,401 – R12,760,000 | R106,898 + 11% of value above R2,996,400 |
| R12,760,001+ | R1,180,894 + 13% of value above R12,760,000 |

**Note:** If purchasing from a VAT-registered developer, transfer duty is exempt (VAT applies instead).

---

### 2.2 Fractional Ownership Structures

**What we do:** Enable multiple buyers to co-own a single property

#### Structure Options

| Structure | Legal Basis | Pros | Cons | Regulatory Burden |
|-----------|-------------|------|------|-------------------|
| **Undivided shares** | Common law co-ownership | Can be bonded in Deeds Office | Complex exit, unanimous decisions | Low |
| **Share Block** | Share Blocks Control Act | Established framework | No title ownership, share block company overhead | Medium |
| **SPV (Pty Ltd)** | Companies Act | Flexibility, limited liability | Company admin, tax inefficiency | Medium |
| **Trust** | Trust Property Control Act | Asset protection | Trustee complexity, costs | Medium-High |
| **Collective Investment Scheme** | CISCA | Regulated, investor protection | FSCA license required, heavy compliance | Very High |

#### Regulatory Warning: Collective Investment Schemes

If Keystay pools investor funds to acquire properties on their behalf, this may constitute a **Collective Investment Scheme** under CISCA, requiring:

- FSCA registration as a CIS manager
- Independent custodian for investor funds
- Extensive compliance and reporting

**Recommendation:** Structure fractional ownership as direct co-ownership (undivided shares) or share blocks, NOT as pooled investment schemes. Seek legal opinion before proceeding.

#### FAIS Considerations

If Keystay provides advice on which properties to buy as "investments," this may trigger FAIS licensing requirements:

| Activity | FAIS Required? |
|----------|----------------|
| Showing available properties | No |
| Providing ROI calculations | Possibly — grey area |
| Recommending specific properties as investments | Yes — requires FSP license |
| Discretionary investment decisions | Yes — Category II FSP |

**Recommendation:** Position Keystay as a property services platform, not an investment advisor. Include disclaimers. Seek legal opinion.

---

### 2.3 Tenant Placement

**What we do:** Find, vet, and place tenants (long-term or short-term)

#### Required Registrations

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| PPRA Registration | Rental agents must be registered property practitioners |
| Fidelity Fund Certificate | Required if handling deposits |
| FIC Registration | Required for tenant verification |

#### Tenant Screening Requirements

|-------|----------|---------|

#### Deposit Handling (Rental Housing Act)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Interest-bearing account | Deposit must be held in interest-bearing account |
| Property practitioner trust account | If agent handles deposit |
| Interest belongs to tenant | Must accrue to tenant's benefit |
| Proof of interest | Tenant can request written proof during lease |
| Refund timelines | 7 days (no damages), 14 days (damages), 21 days (refused inspection) |
| Joint inspection | Required at move-in and move-out |

**Critical:** Landlords/agents can only deduct for tenant-caused damage, not normal wear and tear. Must provide receipts.

|-------------|---------|
| PPRA Registration | Property managers must be registered |

### 2.5 Short-Term Rentals (Airbnb, etc.)

**What we do:** List properties on Airbnb/Booking.com, manage guest bookings, cleaning, maintenance

#### National Framework (Evolving)

| Current Status | Emerging |
|----------------|----------|
| No national short-term rental register | Department of Tourism finalising national regulations |
| No nationwide night cap | Mandatory registration with tourism boards coming |
| No universal licensing | Hospitality taxes and health/safety standards expected |

#### Municipal Regulations

| City | Regulations | Key Points |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Cape Town** | Municipal Planning By-Laws (2019) | Max 30 consecutive days same guest; zoning consent may be required; sectional title schemes can impose restrictions |
| **Johannesburg** | No specific bylaws | Relies on existing zoning regulations; body corporate restrictions apply |
| **Durban** | No specific bylaws | Similar to Joburg — zoning and body corporate |

#### Sectional Title / Body Corporate

Many Airbnb properties are in sectional title schemes. Key considerations:

- Body corporates can restrict or prohibit short-term rentals
- Rules are legally enforceable
- Must obtain approval from scheme
- May face additional levies or guest registration requirements

#### VAT Implications

| Scenario | VAT Treatment |
|----------|---------------|
| Short-term rental income < R1m/year | No VAT registration required |
| Short-term rental income > R1m/year | Must register for VAT, charge 15% |
| Long-term residential rental | Exempt from VAT (regardless of amount) |

#### Property Rates Impact (Cape Town)

If property is not a primary residence OR >40% used for short-lets:
- May be rated as **Commercial Accommodation** under Rates Policy 2025/26
- Higher rates apply

#### Existing Airbnb Management Companies (Potential Partners)

| Company | Location | Services | Commission |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Houst** | Cape Town, Joburg | Full management | 14-20% |
| **Propr Luxury Homes** | CT, Sandton, Umhlanga | Full management + API integration | Variable |
| **HostAgents** | Cape Town | Full management | Variable |
| **LaStay** | Multiple | Full or co-host | Variable |
| **The Co-Host Collection** | Cape Town | Full service + investment advice | Variable |

**Opportunity:** Partner with existing Airbnb managers OR build internal capability. Consider white-labelling.
