# Keystay: Competitor Analysis

**Date:** 20 January 2026
**Purpose:** Understand the competitive landscape, identify weaknesses, and position Keystay

---

## Executive Summary

The South African property investment and management market has several established players, but **all of them share common weaknesses**: poor communication, lack of transparency, technology gaps, and locked ecosystems. This creates a clear opportunity for Keystay.

---

## Competitor 1: IGrow Wealth Investments

**Model:** Vertically integrated — development → sales → finance → rental management
**Scale:** Claims 220,000+ investors
**Website:** [igrow.co.za](https://igrow.co.za/)

### What They Do Well
- Full vertical integration (exactly what Keystay wants to build)
- Strong marketing and positioning
- National footprint (Cape Town, Pretoria, Johannesburg)
- Educational content and seminars

### What People Complain About

| Complaint Category | Specific Issues | Source |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Communication** | "Days would pass with radio silence"; "No one was actually working on my issue unless I chased them" | [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/igrow.co.za) |
| **Locked Ecosystem** | "You will be locked into the IGrow ecosphere for any properties bought through IGrow" — no control over rental agent or self-management | [LocalMoney](https://localmoney.co.za/igrow-wealth-investments-a-review-for-south-african-property-investors/) |
| **Hidden Fees** | "Every department takes a cut"; fees charged whether or not property has tenant | Trustpilot |
| **Developer Partnerships** | "IGrow partnered with a developer that was a complete crook" | Trustpilot |
| **Property Management** | Properties not advertised (lost rental income); unresolved maintenance; "No repairs done since December 2024" | Trustpilot, HelloPeter |
| **Rental Agent Transparency** | "Rental agents aren't transparent about fees"; cleaning/maintenance not done properly for new tenants | HelloPeter |
| **Customer Service** | "Please stay as far away from IGROW as possible"; "the most incompetent Rental Agency in South Africa"; "RUN the other way" | Trustpilot |

### Critical Review Quote
> "IGrow is a wealth trap, built on greasy tactics, under-exaggerated projections, and endless hidden costs."
> — 5-year investor, Trustpilot

### Trustpilot Rating
**3.6/5** (217 reviews as of early 2025) — Note: "The lack of complete transparency raises questions about potential review management practices"

### IGrow's Strategic Weakness
They're big but broken. Communication is terrible, customers feel trapped, and the "hands-off" promise doesn't deliver. **Keystay opportunity: Do what they do, but actually be good at it.**

---

## Competitor 2: EasyProperties

**Model:** Fractional ownership via company shares
**Parent:** EasyEquities (Purple Group)
**Minimum Investment:** R10,000
**Website:** [properties.easyequities.co.za](https://properties.easyequities.co.za/)

### What They Do Well
- Very low entry point (R10,000)
- Part of established EasyEquities ecosystem
- Regulated (FSP license)

### What People Complain About

| Complaint Category | Specific Issues | Source |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Not Real Ownership** | "You don't actually buy property—you buy shares in a company that owns the property" | [CrowdSQ](https://crowdsq.com/blog/659/independent-review-of-easyproperties-should-you-invest) |
| **Illiquidity** | "The inability to sell shares outside of the auction calendar is a major inconvenience"; "challenging to exit investments" | CrowdSQ |
| **Customer Service** | "Lack of communication and unresponsiveness from team"; difficulties withdrawing funds | CrowdSQ |
| **Allegations** | "Pressured into paying fees before finalizing documents"; barriers to retrieving investments | CrowdSQ |
| **Platform Issues** | "Liquidity pool problem"; "dismal support"; KYC system issues, unanswered tickets | Trustpilot |

### EasyProperties Strategic Weakness
Fractional model means **no real ownership** — you own company shares, not property. Exit is difficult. **Keystay opportunity: Full ownership option with real title deed.**

---

## Competitor 3: Crowdprop

**Model:** Property crowdfunding (fractional)
**Minimum Investment:** R10,000
**Regulatory Status:** Registered FSP
**Website:** [crowdprop.co.za](https://crowdprop.co.za/)

### Assessment
- Appears legitimate (ScamAdviser positive)
- Low traffic/user base (Tranco ranking low)
- Limited public reviews/complaints found
- Similar fractional model to EasyProperties

### Crowdprop Strategic Weakness
Small player, limited track record, fractional only. **Keystay opportunity: Offer both fractional AND full ownership.**

---

## Competitor 4: Mafadi Property Management

**Model:** Property management (not investor sourcing)
**Scale:** 28,000+ properties under management
**Locations:** Johannesburg CBD, Midrand, Centurion, Pretoria, KZN
**Website:** [mafadi.co.za](https://mafadi.co.za/)

### What They Do Well
- Large portfolio (28,000 properties)
- Regional coverage (Gauteng + KZN)
- Multiple property types (residential, student, commercial)

### What People Complain About

| Complaint Category | Specific Issues | Source |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Communication** | "Most unprofessional and unresponsive managing agents"; "Communication is non-existent" | [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/mafadi.co.za) |
| **Maintenance** | Water leak unresolved for 2+ months; lightbulb replacement took over a month; building exterior unpainted for years | Trustpilot |
| **Operations** | "Runs their operations like a spaza shop"; rules not formally communicated | Trustpilot |
| **Billing** | Disputed charges; wrongly billed during "1 month rent free" promo | Trustpilot |
| **Service Disruption** | Sudden electricity disconnections | Trustpilot |

### HelloPeter Ratings
- Mafadi Property Management: 7.2 TrustIndex
- Mafadi Property Services: 4.7 TrustIndex

### Mafadi Strategic Profile
They're a **potential partner**, not a competitor. They have scale but terrible systems. **Could benefit from Keystay's technology and processes.**
